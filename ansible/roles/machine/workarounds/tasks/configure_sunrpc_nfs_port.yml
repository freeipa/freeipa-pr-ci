# The default value of sunrpc.min_resvport is 665. An NFS mount can block
# the kadmin service port and cause IPA installation to fail.
#
# `nfs-utils` must be installed, thus it was added to
# `ansible/roles/machine/setup/tasks/install_packages.yml`, otherwise it would
# be only installed later by Vagrant when bringing the machine.
